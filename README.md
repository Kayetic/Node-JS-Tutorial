# Welcome to Node-JS-Tutorial ðŸ‘‹

Hey there, it's @Kayetic! ðŸš€
This is another one of those boring repos where people 'practice'.

## What in the world?

Don't mind the clutter, it's just my learning path. ðŸ›  No "installation" required, just good old-fashioned curiosity to peek around.

Some **technologies** that will be used:

- NodeJS (surprise!)
- JavaScript
- Database system like PostgreSQL or MongoDB

## Anything special? ðŸŒŸ

Nothing "magical" here either ðŸ”®, just the enchantment of a journey through the unknown, one line of code at a time.

## So what can I look forward to? ðŸ’­

Future plans? Well, let's just say NodeJS is the appetizer, the main course is yet to be served. **Stay tuned!** ðŸŽ‰
